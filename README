Terminology
---------------------
Infinote Server: Server hosting collaborative editing sessions

Session: A collaborative editing instance of a note

Note: An editable document on an infinote server


Starting an Infinote Serever
----------------------
Kobby does not have the ability to start an infinote server.  If you would like
to run an infinote server, you can use the 'infinoted' application installed
with libinfinity.

Example usage, using no encryption:
infinoted --security-polity=no-tls


Connecting to an Infinote Server
---------------------
Open a 'New Connection' dialog by going to File->New Connection.  Enter A name
for the connection, the hostname (or IP address) of the server, and the port it
is running on (usually 6523).  You will then be able to browse the connection in
the 'Remote Browser' tab.
