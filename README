kte-collaborative: Collaborative Text Editor for KDE

Terminology
---------------------
Infinote Server: Server hosting collaborative editing sessions

Session: A collaborative editing instance of a note

Note: An editable document on an infinote server


Starting an Infinote Serever
----------------------
kte-collaborative does not have the ability to start an infinote server.  If you would like
to run an infinote server, you can use the 'infinoted' application installed
with libinfinity.

Example usage, using no encryption:
infinoted --security-polity=no-tls

On some systems, the executable might be called infinoted-0.5 or -0.6.


Connecting to an Infinote Server
---------------------
kte-collaborative treats each file with an URL which uses the inf:// protocol as a collaborative
document. You can thus just open inf://myusername@servername.tld:port/path/to/document.txt in the
editor, and the plugin should connect you to the session. You can also use the File -> Open dialog
to select the document after entering the base URL. Alternatively, you can use Collaborative ->
Open collaborative document for a nice GUI for entering connection parameters.
You can also use Telepathy to establish pseudo peer-to-peer connections to jabber contacts from
the same menu.
