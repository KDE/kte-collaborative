If you already have libinfinitymm installed, you can skip to the Kobby section.

Libinfinitymm:
Libinfinitymm is a set of C++ bidings for libinfinity.  To install libinfinitymm you will need to have libinfinity and glibmm installed.  Libinfinity can be checked out using git with the following command:

	git clone git://git.0x539.de/git/infinote.git

Glibmm is from the makers of Gtkmm and can be found on their website:

	http://www.gtkmm.org/download.shtml

Kobby:
Kobby uses CMake to build and install.  If you build KDE with the 'cmakekde' command, you need only run that, otherwise you must first run:

	'cmake .'

to configure Kobby for your system.  After cmake has finished you can run:

	'make && sudo make install'

to build and install Kobby on your system.
