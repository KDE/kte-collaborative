Dependencies:
    libinfinity
    libqinfinity (from git://anongit.kde.org/libqinfinity.git)
    kde-telepathy-common-internals

Installation:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. [your cmake flags]
    make install

Usage:
    After installing, reboot or kill mission-control-5 and telepathy-gabble, and
    run kbuildsycoca. Also make sure $KDEDIRS contains your installation prefix.
    Then, launch any KTextEditor-based application (kate, kwrite, kile, KDevelop, ...)
    and you should have a "Collaborative" menu. The rest should hopefully be obvious.
